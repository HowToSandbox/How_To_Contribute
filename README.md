How To Contribute
======

This organizations spirit is to provide working repositories of code that show how to implament a technology in a tutorial format. We want YOUR help in building this community and providing working examples of code in specific technologies for people to work from. 

# Why are we doing this?
Learning from books and blogs and videos is invaluable. However at a certain point many of us have gotten to a point where we want to see how this code looks when it's implamented and working. There is value in seeing working code, and being able to play with it. So we want to create repositories of working code that people can play with, learn from, crib from, rejigger to suit thier needs, and generally abuse. You know, totally open source stuff. But high quality open source stuff that is loved and cared for.

# How can you help?
If you know a technology well enough to teach it to people, write some code for the project. We have some guidelines to make things a little more uniform, such as, it must have tests, it must be under Continuous Integration and the tests must pass. We are currently in the process of making it up as we go along, so pitch in, and help make it up!
